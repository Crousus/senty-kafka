          "description": "Civic Type R fans, this one’s for you! \n\nWe’ve got our hands on every generation of Civic Type R, and they’re about to face off over the quarter mile to see just how much the Type R has evolved since 2001! \n\nNow of course, it should come as no surprise that the older editions come at a disadvantage when it comes to power output. If you take a look at the original EP3, it comes with a 2-litre naturally-aspirated engine (with VTEC!) that can produce 200hp and 196Nm of torque. In comparison, the all-new FL5 comes with a 2-litre turbo petrol engine that can produce 320hp and 420Nm! \n\nBut of course, don’t forget that they’re all on a level playing field in that they’re all FWD, and they’re all manuals! The question is, will the new FL5 prove to be worth its eye-watering £47,000 price tag?\n\nThere’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!\n\nMat’s hot hatch deal: https://bit.ly/Mats-Hot-Hatch-Deal-0403\n\nPorche 911 Turbo generations: https://bit.ly/Porsche-911-Turbo-Generations\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW",

            "description": "Civic Type R fans, this one’s for you! \n\nWe’ve got our hands on every generation of Civic Type R, and they’re about to face off over the quarter mile to see just how much the Type R has evolved since 2001! \n\nNow of course, it should come as no surprise that the older editions come at a disadvantage when it comes to power output. If you take a look at the original EP3, it comes with a 2-litre naturally-aspirated engine (with VTEC!) that can produce 200hp and 196Nm of torque. In comparison, the all-new FL5 comes with a 2-litre turbo petrol engine that can produce 320hp and 420Nm! \n\nBut of course, don’t forget that they’re all on a level playing field in that they’re all FWD, and they’re all manuals! The question is, will the new FL5 prove to be worth its eye-watering £47,000 price tag?\n\nThere’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!\n\nMat’s hot hatch deal: https://bit.ly/Mats-Hot-Hatch-Deal-0403\n\nPorche 911 Turbo generations: https://bit.ly/Porsche-911-Turbo-Generations\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW"

Well, Mat is here to run you through these two contenders to see which is best! \n\nWhen it comes to the design, these two are pretty different to each other but still look good from the outside. Not only are they both imposing due to their size, but they both manage to stand out. The Range Rover looks sophisticated from the front to the back, while the BMW X7 looks pretty imposing with an aggressive front end. \n\nBoth cars come with a high-quality interior, too. The X7’s cabin is covered in high-quality materials, and this face-lifted edition comes with BMW’s all-new infotainment screen and system - the same one as found in the new iX. It comes with a number of physical buttons, and almost most controls are managed within the screen. The Range Rover also has an all-new infotainment system, coupled with a large infotainment screen on the dash. It has more physical buttons than the BMW, but unfortunately, there are a couple of bits of plastic trim to be found. \n\nBoth cars come with various engine options, and the range-topper in both is a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8. However, while the Range Rover can produce 523hp, BMW is slightly up on power, at 530hp. \n\nFinally, we have the price. Naturally, neither car is cheap, but while the BMW X7 range kicks off at £85,000, the Range Rover comes in a fair bit higher, at £107,000! If you want the two cars we have here, they will cost you £116,000 and £127,000 respectively. \n\nSo which is best - the X7 M60i, or the Range Rover LWB?

Starting with the GR86, it’s powered by a 2.4-litre 4-cylinder that can produce 234hp and 260Nm of torque. It’s equipped with a manual gearbox which drives the rear wheels only, and it tips the scales at 1,274kg. \n\nIn terms of the Supra, it’s equipped with a 3-litre turbo 6L that can produce 326hp and 434Nm. It’s heavier than the GR86, at 1,490kg, and it’s also equipped with a manual gearbox that drives the rear wheels. \n\nSo on paper, you might think it’ll be a clear win for the Supra. But will it be able to launch well in these slippery conditions?

            "description": "How’s this for a Toyota RWD drag race! \n\nWe’ve got our hands on an all-new Toyota GR86 and it’s going head-to-head against a Mk4 Supra! \n\nSo let’s see how the two compare. Starting with the GR86, it’s powered by a 2.4-litre 4-cylinder that can produce 234hp and 260Nm of torque. It’s equipped with a manual gearbox which drives the rear wheels only, and it tips the scales at 1,274kg. \n\nIn terms of the Supra, it’s equipped with a 3-litre turbo 6L that can produce 326hp and 434Nm. It’s heavier than the GR86, at 1,490kg, and it’s also equipped with a manual gearbox that drives the rear wheels. \n\nSo on paper, you might think it’ll be a clear win for the Supra. But will it be able to launch well in these slippery conditions? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!\n\nThanks to Ben for joining us: @BenCollinsDrives \n\nThanks to Ross for helping to supply these cars: https://www.instagram.com/s18rsg/\n\n……..……..……..……..……..……..……..……..……..\n\nMat’s sporty car deal: https://bit.ly/Mats-Sporty-Car-Deal\n\nSupra drag race: https://bit.ly/Mega-Supra-Drag-Race\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW"

Starting with the BMW, it’s powered by a 3-litre twin-turbo straight-six that can produce 510hp and 650Nm of torque. It drives all four wheels, weighs in at 1,865kg, and the price starts from £85,000. \n\nAs for the Audi, it’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet that’s good for 600hp and 800Nm of torque. It’s equipped with Quattro all-wheel drive, tips the scales at 2,075kg, and the price starts from £113,000. \n\nSo what do you think - will the BMW’s weight advantage be enough to snatch the win?
